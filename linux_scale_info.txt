Gnome Wayland on Ubuntu
	Out-of-the-box Scaling capabilities:
		Scaling support: Acceptable
		Per-monitor scale: yes
		Fractional scaling: yes, unusable blurry upscaling for most apps not supporting wayland
	System info:
		GTK api scale factors (gdk_monitor_get_scale_factor): rounded up values from sysem settings
		Xft.dpi: always 96
		Xrandr: no transform matrix. Output area is smaller than monitor resolution in case fractional scale is selected
		Settings file: ~/.config/monitors.xml
		Environment Variables: No
	Notes:
		gdk_x11_screen_get_monitor_output crashes with seg fault, need to investigate how to get monitor name in gtk, because gtk and xrandr may return monitors in different order (VirtualBox),
		As a workaround mapping can be made by coordinates, they are same in Gtk and Randr. Sizes though may differ by few pixels (VirtualBox)
    
Gnome Wayland on Fedora
	Same as previous except:
		Fractional scaling not configurable from UI
		No ~/.config/monitors.xml settings file
		Xft.dpi: 96 * primary monitor scale
		
KDE on openSUSE
	Out-of-the-box Scaling capabilities:
		Scaling support: Average
		Per-monitor scale: no
		Fractional scaling: yes
	System info:
		GTK api scale factors (gdk_monitor_get_scale_factor): rounded down value from sysem settings
		Xft.dpi: 96 * scale factor
		Xrandr: no transform matrix. Output area equal to display resolution
		Environment Variables: Yes   
			QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS list of monitors in format Name=Value separated with ";", Value is from system settings and same for all, i.e. eDP-1=2.25;DP-1=2.25;DP-2=2.25;DP-3=2.25;
			QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR: 0
			GDK_SCALE: if scale >= 2 then is set to one rounded down value from sysem settings
			GDK_DPI_SCALE: if scale >= 2 then is set to 1 divided by rounded down value from sysem settings
	
Deepin on Deepin
	Same as previous except:
		Environment Variables: 
			QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS - values same as Xft.dpi for each monitor, format: Value;Value
		
XFCE on Manjaro
	Out-of-the-box Scaling capabilities:
		Scaling support: Weak
		Per-monitor scale: theoretically yes, completely broken
		Fractional scaling: theoretically yes, and unlike others support values < 1, but completely broken 
		Comment:
			It has scaling settings in two places, Display settings and Appearance->Window Scale, first one sets xrandr matrix, second one - Gtk scale
			Option in display settings actually scales down instead, factors < 1 scales up blurry. Also it sets incorrect value to xrandr. In example: 
				per-display scale to 1 and window scale x2 = App scale 200%
				per-display scale to 1.5 and window scale x2 = App scale 133% (because randr matrix is incorrect)
				per-display scale to 2 and window scale x2 = 100%	
	System info:
		GTK api scale factors (gdk_monitor_get_scale_factor): same value for all monitors from Appearance->Window Scale UI setting
		Xft.dpi: always 96
		Xrandr: always has per monitor scale factor in transform matrix as is. Output area equal to display resolution * per monitor scale factor from display settings
		Environment Variables: No   
		
MATE on Debian
	Out-of-the-box Scaling capabilities:
		Scaling support: Average
		Per-monitor scale: no
		Fractional scaling: no
		Comment: No choice of values, just Regular or HiDpi in System-Preferences->LookAndFeel->MATE Tweak, which is usually x1 or x2
	System info:
		GTK api scale factors (gdk_monitor_get_scale_factor): same value for all monitors from system setting (System-Preferences->LookAndFeel->MATE Tweak)
		Xft.dpi: always 96
		Xrandr: no transform matrix. Output area equal to display resolution
		Environment Variables: Yes   
			QT_SCALE_FACTOR: If configured for HiDpi then 2, else missing
		
LXQt on Lubuntu
	Out-of-the-box Scaling capabilities:
		Scaling support: Weak
		Per-monitor scale: no
		Fractional scaling: yes
	System info:
		GTK api scale factors (gdk_monitor_get_scale_factor): same value for all monitors from system settings, rounded down
		Xft.dpi: Not present
		Xrandr: no transform matrix. Output area equal to display resolution
		Environment Variables: Yes   
			QT_SCALE_FACTOR: scale factor from system settings
			GDK_SCALE: scale factor from system settings
		
Cinnamon on Mint
	Out-of-the-box Scaling capabilities:
		Scaling support: Great
		Per-monitor scale: yes
		Fractional scaling: yes (can be disabled, but per-monitor feature will be lost)
	System info:
		GTK api scale factors (gdk_monitor_get_scale_factor): rounded up per monitor values from system settings
		Xft.dpi: 96 * max rounded up value from system settings
		Xrandr: if there are no fractional scaling for any monitor then no transform matrix. Output area equal to display resolution,
			if there is fractional scaling then transform matrix is used and output area equal to display resolution * 2 / per monitor scale factor from display settings
		Environment Variables: No
		Settings file: ~/.config/cinnamon-monitors.xml (same format as in Ubuntu)
